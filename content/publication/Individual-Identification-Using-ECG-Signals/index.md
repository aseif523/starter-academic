abstract: " Over the last decade, the Electrocardiogram (ECG) became
known as an emerging biometric instrument for individual
identification and verification. The ECG varies among people
because of their diverse anatomy of the heart. At present ECG
is a popular research topic in the area of physiological
biometrics. This paper investigates the use of ECG for person
recognition through the extraction of fiducial feature. Firstly,
it provides a survey of existing work in this field. It also
showcases the available ECG databases for biometrics.
Previous work indicated that ECG recognition is suitable for
small sample size, therefore this paper further looks in using a
big sample size. Moreover, this paper investigates the 13
pertinent features using a large database of healthy and
unhealthy subjects with different cardiac conditions. Finally, it
presents a comparative analysis of different classifiers
(Support Vector Machine SVM, Decision Tree DT, and
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network MLP NN) resulting in
the MLP NN being the most optimum classifier for ECG
recognition. "
